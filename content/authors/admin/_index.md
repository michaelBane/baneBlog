I am an applied scientist that loves a challenge. I've worn a few hats along the road to get to where i am now (Head of ML Engineering at Electronic Arts). I started my career studying Physics and Chemistry which culminated in a PhD in the field of [High-Resolution FTIR Spectroscopy](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Far-infrared_ro-vibrational_spectroscopy_of_coriolis_coupled_molecules_of_interstellar_importance_/4664431/1). I switched gears into Statistics and Machine Learning during my post-grad studies which lead me to industry. I have worked in games for the past 6 years, playing the role of BI analyst, Data Scientist and People Manager to name a few.

The purpose of this blog is three-fold. Firstly, i love writing about data and analytics as a creative outlet ([Tennis](https://theconversation.com/profiles/michael-bane-17384/articles), [Hearthstone](https://articles.hsreplay.net/author/baney64/)). Secondly, im less of a "dooer" these days and this kind of project scratches an itch for me. Finally, id love to get more involved in the analytics community.
